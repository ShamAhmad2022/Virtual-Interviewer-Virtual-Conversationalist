  "Hey, have you checked out that new coffee shop that opened up down the street?",
  "Yeah, I went there yesterday. It is pretty cozy, right?",
  "Definitely! I loved the vibe in there. And their cappuccino was amazing",
  "I know! And did you see those comfy couches by the window?",
  "Yeah, I could hang out there all day. Plus, the staff were so friendly",
  "Agreed. It's nice to have a new spot to hang out in the neighborhood",
  "Totally. We should go there together sometime"

  "Hey, have you heard about the new game that just came out?",
  "Yeah, I saw some ads for it. What is it about?",
  "It's a survival game set in a post-apocalyptic world. You have to scavenge for resources and fight off mutants",
  "That sounds intense. Is it any good?",
  "I played it for a bit last night, and it's pretty addictive. The graphics are amazing, and the storyline keeps you hooked",
  "Nice! I might have to check it out. How is the multiplayer aspect?",
  "It's great. You can team up with friends to tackle missions and build bases together",
  "That sounds like a blast. We should definitely try it together",
  "Absolutely! I'll shoot you a message when I'm online"

export const bestProgrammingLanguage = [
  "So, what programming languages do you use?",
  "I use Java",
  "Java? That's so outdated. You should give Python a try. It's much more versatile. I use Python for most of my projects",
  "I see your point, but Java is still widely used and reliable",
  "Python is just so much more user-friendly and flexible. You'd love it",
  "I've heard good things about Python, but I'm comfortable with Java structure",
  "Come on, why stick with something old when there's something better out there?",
  "Look, I appreciate your enthusiasm, but I have my reasons for sticking with Java",
  "Suit yourself. But don't blame me when you realize you're falling behind the curve"
